#smashcontrol-simpletext

This is intended to be a simple graphics bundle run with [nodecg-smashcontrol](https://github.com/smashcontrol/nodecg-smashcontrol) to display
information generated there. Check out the documentation there for more info.  
  
 The JS file in `graphics` will give a decent idea on how to get the information from the main
 application, as well as putting it into an HTML file. From there, it's just a matter of positioning
 the elements in relation to the layout via CSS and/or further HTML. One example of a completed layout can be found 
 with [RIT Smash Club's layout](https://github.com/swc19/rit-graphics).
 
 
 ###Installation
 
View the instructions in [nodecg-smashcontrol](https://github.com/smashcontrol/nodecg-smashcontrol) to install that,
then run `nodecg install smashcontrol/smashcontrol-simpletext` to get this bundle.
